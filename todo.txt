* Infinite events
	* Current idea: Create hook that is called if date is past a certain
	  threshold that creates a set time's worth of events

	* Use a data file to store the infinite events and their rrules, etc.
	  that gets parsed to create the events

	* Make the .date file for infinite events separate
